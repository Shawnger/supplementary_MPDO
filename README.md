# supplementary_MPDO
This is a supplement  to arxiv:2010.14682v1 (Matrix Product Density Operators: when do they have a local parent Hamiltonian?). This code implements the algorithm mentioned in Proposition III.6. It checks whether Condition 2 of Theorem III.3 holds for Kraus operators arising from the measured MPDO at Fig. 2 (Bottom). We sampled 100 times for each fixed bond dimension, and found there is no exception up to d=D=8. All sample Haar random unitary instances induce exponentially decaying CMI after the local measurement.  One can also check Condition 2 for arbitrary Kraus representations of Y-shaped channels.
