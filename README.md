# supplementary_MPDO
 This is a supplement to arxiv:2010.14682v1 (Matrix Product Density Operators: when do they have a local parent Hamiltonian?). 
 This code implements Proposition III.6, checking whether Condition 2 of Theorem III.3 holds for Kraus operators arising from the measured MPDO at fig. 2 Bottom. There has been no exceptions so far up to d~8, i.e. each instance would have exponential decaying CMI. One can also check for arbitary family of MPDOs, given the Kraus operators.
